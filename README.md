# Pirate-IntelligentAgent
Final project for CS-370 - Current/Emerging Trends in CS. Building an AI agent that solves a maze

## Final Project

For this project, I had to complete the Q-Training algorithm in order to get the AI to work effectively. The goal was to find the best possible navigation sequence that would result in the "pirate" (agent) to reach the treasure (end of maze)
